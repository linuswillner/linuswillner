**Hello, fellow members of the human race 👋🏻**

I'm Linus, a software development multitool from Finland. 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [Reaktor](https://reaktor.com).

I'm an engineer and all-round technology enthusiast. My core competence is full-stack development, but I've also been working in JVM languages lately (mainly Scala and Java) and I have a fair bit of experience in wrangling IT infrastructure, like setting up networks and servers on-site (so not just cloud). On the more esoteric side, I've dabbled in game modding and using my software engineering skills to smoothen my game modding workflows.

Despite my rather vibrant commit history at times, I don't do a whole lot of open-source work these days. Apart from the things I can't publish, I haven't really come up with a lot of ideas that I would feel are worth showcasing on here. You could say my best ideas are private. 😄 Sorry if what you were expecting here was a portfolio of my more recent work; perhaps one of those ideas will make the spotlight one day. 🕵🏻‍♂️

If I were to describe myself in one sentence: I'm an engineer; I solve problems. Computers are often involved, but the hardest problems invariably involve humans.
