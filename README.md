**Hello, fellow members of the human race üëã**

I'm Linus, a Software Engineering student and software developer from Finland. üë®‚Äçüíª I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [Reaktor](https://reaktor.com). I'm also studying Information and Communication Technology at [Metropolia University of Applied Sciences](https://metropolia.fi), majoring in Software Engineering.

My core competencies lie in full-stack development, DevOps and sysadmin. Some excerpts from the buzzword bingo include JavaScript/TypeScript, modern web development (React/Vue/Svelte and the whole enchilada), Docker and Terraform. I'm decently proficient in Java as well.

Outside of direct technology roles, in my free time, I often work on the intersection between technology and community moderation. While most of my work in this regard is private for security reasons, I have invested significant time into leading the development of highly successful and sophisticated anti-abuse systems on platforms like [Discord](https://discord.com), mainly for my own community [The Coding Den](https://github.com/TheCodingDen). I also work in a core leadership role for the aforementioned group, spearheading the efforts of the staff team there.

In terms of actual tech work experience, I have worked in software development, DevOps and/or systems administration roles for, among others, [Reaktor](https://reaktor.com), [Tarra-Tac](https://tarratac.fi) and the [Finnish Defence Forces](https://puolustusvoimat.fi).

Hope you find the things I have created useful! üòÑ

_(Random fact about me: I'm Finnish but speak and write English with a British diction. üí¨)_
