**Hello, fellow members of the human race 👋🏻**

I'm Linus, a Software Engineering student and software developer from Finland. 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Software Developer at [Reaktor](https://reaktor.com). I'm also studying Information and Communication Technology at [Metropolia University of Applied Sciences](https://metropolia.fi), majoring in Software Engineering.

My core competence is full-stack development, also growing my skillset in DevOps. I have a broad array of relatively surface-level experience with most modern web tech. Furthermore, I have some experience from OOP languages, both JVM and not-JVM (namely Scala, Java and C#, in order of proficiency). My DevOps skillset is currently stronger in "old-school" manual server admin (Windows/Linux), but I've recently been dabbling with AWS and Terraform as well.

Despite my rather vibrant commit history at times, I don't do a whole lot of open-source work these days. Apart from the things I can't publish, I haven't really come up with a lot of ideas that I would feel are worth showcasing on here. You could say my best ideas are private. 😄 Sorry if what you were expecting here was a portfolio of my more recent work; perhaps one of those ideas will make the spotlight one day. 🕵🏻‍♂️

If I were to describe myself in one sentence: I solve problems. Computers are often involved, but the hardest problems invariably involve humans.
