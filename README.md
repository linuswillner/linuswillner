**Hello, fellow members of the human race 👋🏻**

I'm Linus, a software development multitool from Finland. 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Reaktor](https://reaktor.com).

I'm an engineer and all-round technology enthusiast. My core competence is full-stack development, but I also have a fair bit of experience in IT infrastructure and networking, both in the cloud and hands-on with the hardware. On the more esoteric side, I've dabbled in JVM languages (Scala/Java), game modding and using my software engineering skills to smoothen my game modding workflows.

Despite my rather vibrant commit history at times, I don't do a whole lot of open-source work these days. Apart from the things I can't publish, I haven't really come up with a lot of ideas that I would feel are worth showcasing on here. You could say my best ideas are private. 😄 Sorry if what you were expecting here was a portfolio of my more recent work; perhaps one of those ideas will make the spotlight one day. 🕵🏻‍♂️

If I were to describe myself in one sentence: I'm an engineer; I solve problems. Computers are often involved, but the hardest problems invariably involve humans.
