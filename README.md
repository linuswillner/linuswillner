**Hello, fellow members of the human race 👋🏻**

I'm Linus, a software engineering multitool from Finland. 👨🏻‍💻 I'm currently working as a Software Engineer at [Reaktor](https://reaktor.com).

I do what you'd call "true full stack IT" - I work on anything from perfecting user interfaces, to engineering backends for those user interfaces, to tweaking the servers this entire software stack runs on, all the way down to working with the physical hardware all of this happens inside. If it's a computer, I can work it. 💻

My career path to software engineering is quite untraditional. I started in basic close user support, from where I expanded to systems and network administration, and then I learned to code by accident during secondary school, from where I went on to learn software engineering at university. This "breadth-first" approach has resulted in there being no layer in the software stack that eludes my understanding, and I've found the most success in projects where I can get to work with all of these. 🔧

I hold a particular passion for public sector technology and education technology specifically. I think the most interesting applications for technology happen when the motivators are something else than purely financial. That's how I ended up in this job, after all. If you're a young technologist in Finland, you might recognise this story as [something you've seen before](https://www.reaktor.com/insights-and-events/if-at-first-you-don-t-succeed).

In my free time I like to do personal network design, dabble in game modding and open an SSH session to my home server every once in a while. If I had a proper house, I'd probably spend my time writing software for it, but I'm not quite there yet.

If I were to describe myself in one sentence: I'm an engineer; I solve problems. Computers are often involved, but the hardest problems invariably involve humans.
